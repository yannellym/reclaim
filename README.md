## Overview
### Description
ReClaim is an exclusive marketplace for people to trade, collect, and post recyclable goods in NYC. You get to help the earth and get some cool recyclable goods at the same time.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Recycling
- **Desktop:** This app is primarily developed for desktop, it is similar to Meta's marketplace. A mobile version is expected later on this year.
- **Story:** Users can trade, collect, and post recyclable goods in NYC. 
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment. It is focused on invidiuals that want to keep the earth clean and care about recycling. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wants. It depends on how much they care about the environment, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** The first step is to roll it out in NYC. Analyze how people interact, and how much they recycle. Then, the goal would be to expand to different states. An addition to the product would be a community forum.
